This is a demonstrator function to test and exercise basic functions of SQLlite. It has no GUI. It contains
three tables: a product tabale, a persons (ie "customers") table and an orders table.

The functions are simple a list of persons has an "account balance" from which they can "buy" items in the 
Products table. The transacations are recorded in the orders table.

Future functions will be added to assure that sufficient balance in the customers table is available 
to cover transactions and inventory will be tracked to make sure orders can be fulfilled

Addtional functions to analyze historical data may be added in the future
